Let's start off with the most common graph game.
There are two players playing a game.
In one move, you have to move to any of the neighbouring vertices. 
If you are not able to move, you simply lose.
Given a starting vertex, determine whether player 1 is going to win or lose or whether the game ends in draw, provided that both the players play optimally.

Observations:
- The game ends up in a draw, only if the graph is cyclic. Cuz, you can just move in the cycle repeatedly and never reach a final end.
- If the graph is a DAG (Directed acyclic graph), then the possibilities are either win/lose.

Now the question is, how do you determine whether given a node, player 1 wins or not??
You start off from right to left (right as in the node that has an outdegree of 0) and mark that node as the losing node.
If you start at the losing node - you lose.

Now, all the nodes that are connected to a losing node will automatically becoming a winning node.
Why? Cuz, player 1 can simply move from that node to the connected losing node which puts player 2 in a losing position.

If you are at a node that leads to all winning nodes, then that node is a losing node because if you move to any neighbouring node, you are putting
player 2 in a winning position.

Summary: You start off from the right most node i.e outdegree = 0 and start determining all nodes from right to left as whether they are losing nodes, or
winning nodes. 

There are mutliple other games that involve the cost of the edge and asymmetric games which can be found in pashka's video.
